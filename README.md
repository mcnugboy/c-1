#Notes
In this Module we learned about proper semantic HTML. In this code I changed a lot of the div tags to more detailed, semantic attributes. Such as: header, footer, section. After I changed some tags I had to make the CSS work, I pretty much just had to change the mother attribute in the style syntax. As the code had some Div tags with classes such as header, footer, hero section, I had to delete those periods in front of the class names and put the correct semantic style attribute. None of the functions on the site were changed just the readability of the code.
